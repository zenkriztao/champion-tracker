## Observation #13: Longest Module Names

In this list, the longest "organic" module names. Many modules that are originally from games have been prefixed in the Amiga Music Preservation database with the corresponding game name, like [(Charm Tale 2 Mermaid Lagoon)into the great deep](https://champion-tracker.net/mod?id=117455) - I'm counting those out from the list below.
